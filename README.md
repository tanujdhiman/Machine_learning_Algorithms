# Machine_learning_Algorithms
Here I have shared with you all the algorithms in Machine Learning. In udemy, there is course of starting new with Machine Learning i.e A-Z Machine learning. In this tutorial they will explain briely each and every step 
in implementing these algorithms. If you can't buy this course don't worry I have shared all the code regarding this course.
Algorithms are :
1. Data Preprocesing
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Multiple Regression 
4. Polynomial Linear Regression
5. Random Forest Regression
6. Simple Linear Regression
7. Support Vector Regression
8. Decision Tree Classification
9. K-Nearest Neighbor
10. Logistic Regression
11. Navie Bayes
12. Random Forest Classifier
13. Support Vector Machine
14. Natural Language Processing 
15. Hierarchical Clustering
16. Kmeans Clustering
